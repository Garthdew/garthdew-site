    <h1>On Being A Generalist</h1>
    <p>Dont specialise.</p>
    <p>Generalise.</p>
    <p>Specialising made sense in bygone times.</p>
    <p>But now the world moves too fast.</p>
    <p>If I&rsquo;d only stuck to videography for the last 10 years, I&rsquo;d now be vulnerable to advances in technology and global competition.</p>
    <p>Luckily, I&rsquo;ve built a skill stack beyond video.</p>
    <p>A skill stack is a set of complimentary skills that gives you more options and chances of success.</p>
    <p>Through continuous learning, building a business, doing side projects and saying yes to lots of opportunities, I have developed other skills such as:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Content marketing </li>
    <li>Public speaking </li>
    <li>Photography </li>
    <li>Psychology </li>
    <li>Coaching </li>
    <li>Branding </li>
    <li>Writing </li>
    <li>Design</li>
    <li>Sales</li>
    <li>AI</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Layer these skills on top of my core skill of video production, and I have many options for making a living.</p>
    <p>And I don&rsquo;t expect I&rsquo;ll ever be short of opportunities in the future.</p>
    <p>Generalists will adapt and thrive in the next decade.</p>
    <p>Specialists will be replaced by technology or global talent who work for less.</p>

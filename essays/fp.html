    <h1>On Fun And Play</h1>
    <p>When I got home, I wasn't in the mood for being Dad.</p>
    <p>Sometimes, you just want to chill.</p>
    <p>But then I remembered a question I heard that day:</p>
    <p>"How can you lean more in to fun and play?"</p>
    <p>I love that queston.</p>
    <p>Because when I'm having fun, everything is more creative, effortless and amazing.</p>
    <p>So I snapped out of it.</p>
    <p>And I declared 6PM, "The most fun hour of the day."</p>
    <p>I danced like a lunatic with the kids, played twister and acted out an episode of Bluey with some figurines.</p>
    <p>At bath time, my daughter taught me an Abba song they'd learned in school.</p>
    <p>"Su-per per. Troo-per per!"</p>
    <p>We sang it together.</p>
    <p>A couple of hours flew by. We had a good laugh. Everyone went to bed happy.</p>
    <p>It beat forcing them to watch TV and being a grumpy sod.</p>
    <p>So, I set a daily alarm for 6PM.</p>
    <p>Which is now officially "The most fun hour of the day."</p>
    <p>There's a lot of power in living from a context like that.</p>
    <p>And this doesn't only apply to home life.</p>
    <p>How would you show up if you made your work more fun?</p>
    <ul>
    <li>What content would you put out?</li>
    <li>How would you describe your service?</li>
    <li>What would you do to make your clients smile?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I wonder:</p>
    <p>Would coming from that place make more impact on your bottom line?</p>
    <p>Compared to a bland outreach strategy or generic content template?</p>
    <p>So...</p>
    <p>How will you lean in to fun and play today?</p>

    <h1>On Working With Love And Care – Garth Dew</h1>
    <p>For years, I've told everyone, "I hate video editing."</p>
    <p>So, I often outsource it, or procrastinate until the last possible minute.</p>
    <p>The result?</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Work that could be better</li>
    <li>Lots of moaning and dread about the task</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Where does this "hate" come from?</p>
    <p>I've convinced myself that editing is a 'low value task.'</p>
    <p>And it eats up too much time when I should be 'working on my business.'</p>
    <p>And yet, editing is a major part of what I do.</p>
    <p>It's a craft that has taken me years to master.</p>
    <p>It's where a project comes to life and magic can happen.</p>
    <p>And when you hit 'export' on an edit you're proud of, is there a more satisfying feeling?</p>
    <p>Realisation:</p>
    <p>Editing isn't the problem. The story I tell myself about it is.</p>
    <p>Last week, with plenty of editing looming, I decided to try and resolve this.</p>
    <p>And two sources gave me answer.</p>
    <p>First, a passage from a book about Zen on taking pleasure in your work:</p>
    <p>"When we have something arduous to do, we often want to complain about it. We say, 'Anyone could do this.' But with this attitude, it is very difficult to find the joy in our work. People who do their best to enjoy what is before them have the greatest chance to discover inner peace. Often, whatever it is they are enjoying - the thing before them - has the potential to turn into an opportunity. Stop dismissing what you are doing, and start living."</p>
    <p>Second, advice on a brand building course by David Hieatt:</p>
    <p>"Put love and care into everything you do, no matter what it is. People will notice."</p>
    <p>I tried it out.</p>
    <p>I had a series of social media reels to make for a client.</p>
    <p>Normally, I'd rush through it.</p>
    <p>I slowed down, and did the work with love and care.</p>
    <p>I reworked the reels until they were as good as they could be.</p>
    <p>I got locked in to the process, enjoyed the work, and was proud with the end result.</p>
    <p>And, sure enough, they got about 5X more engagement than they usually do.</p>
    <p>The client and their audience noticed.</p>
    <p>I tried to maintain this approach during the weekend.</p>
    <p>Cooking tea, playing with the kids, sweeping the floor, reconciling Xero.</p>
    <p>Going from moment to moment, with presence, love and care.</p>
    <p>It made my moment-to-moment experience so much more joyful.</p>
    <p>And I'm looking at each thing on my to-do list as an opportunity.</p>

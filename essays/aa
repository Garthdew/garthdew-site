    <h1>On Making An Ambient Album</h1>
    <p>I did music production at university, and would get lost in the flow of creating every day.</p>
    <p>12 hours would feel like 12 minutes.</p>
    <p>It was a beautiful time.</p>
    <p>But then I graduated, and needed to make a living.</p>
    <p>Video production seemed the more viable route.</p>
    <p>So I dedicated myself to that for over a decade&mdash;learning skills, getting a job, going freelance, starting a business.</p>
    <p>Making music seemed self-indulgent and pointless.</p>
    <p>But last year, after more than ten years without making music, I felt a strong urge to give my inner artist some love.</p>
    <p>Because deep down, below the faux-layers of conditioning and stories, we are all artists. Watch any child and you'll see that.</p>
    <p>To neglect that essential part of your being is to rob yourself of a full life.</p>
    <p>So in 2024, I gave myself permission to create with no purpose.</p>
    <p>Music, painting, photography&mdash;I played with it all.</p>
    <p>And I started to notice a shift in my daily experience of life.</p>
    <p>I was more present, peaceful, content, and creative.</p>
    <p>Which helped me show up better as a dad, husband and business owner.</p>
    <p>Initially, long-form ambient soundscapes were coming through me.</p>
    <p>But they felt easy and safe. So I wanted to produce an album of shorter tracks.</p>
    <p>And to prevent the overwhelm which stifled me in the past, I decided to set some constraints:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Use only one instrument (my 80s SH101 synth)</li>
    <li>Perform tracks live and improvised with minimal overdubs</li>
    <li>Limit effects to two pedals (delay and reverb)</li>
    <li>Write, record and mix each track in one sitting</li>
    </ol>
    <p>With these constraints, I made my first album in under two weeks, spending just an hour or two a day.</p>
    <p>Is it any good? I don't know. And I don't care. The process was one of the most joyful experiences of my life.</p>
    <p>I called it '<a href="https://garthdew.bandcamp.com/album/flow">Flow</a>'&mdash;the state I long to be in. Where the magic happens as an artist.</p>
    <p>I'm sharing this story to give you permission to show some love to your inner artist. It isn't selfish. It's what you were born to do.</p>

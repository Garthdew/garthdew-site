    <h1>On Robert Rodriguez</h1>
    <p>When filmmaker Robert Rodriguez was 23, he subjected himself to medical trials to fund his first feature length film.</p>
    <p>His idea was to make a practice film for less than $7000 before going on to make his first 'proper' film.</p>
    <p>He wrote the script whilst spending a month locked up in a medical facility.</p>
    <p>He structured it around the things he had at his disposal.</p>
    <p>From friends who could act, to a Mexican ranch, a bus, a turtle and a bar.</p>
    <p>After leaving the medical facility, he borrowed a camera and bought $7000 of film stock.</p>
    <p>Then he got to it.</p>
    <p>He did everything himself - from producing to directing, shooting and editing.</p>
    <p>He pulled in favours, broke the rules and did what no one else thought was possible.</p>
    <p>It was a total guerrilla filmmaking.</p>
    <p>The result was his first film, "El Mariachi."</p>
    <p>What happened next was incredible.</p>
    <p>He cut a trailer for the film, hoping to sell it to the Spanish video market, and started showing it to studios.</p>
    <p>It was so good, Columbia Pictures offered to buy and release the film.</p>
    <p>And they signed Rodriguez to write and direct films for them.</p>
    <p>El Mariachi was then entered into Sundance, and won.</p>
    <p>This catapulted Rodriguez into the big time.</p>
    <p>He has gone on to be one of the most innovative and successful filmmakers of all time.</p>
    <p>All whilst sharing his process and inspiring others to pursue a creative life.</p>
    <p>Here are some of the bits of advice I try to live by:</p>
    <p>1. Take stock of what you already have at your disposal, and use that to drive your project forward.</p>
    <p>2. Forget about rules and conventions. They are there to be broken.</p>
    <p>3. Be a generalist. By learning to do everything, you can save money and have more creative control.</p>
    <p>4. Take on lots of meaningful projects. By chipping away at each one throughout the week, you make continual progress and can live your dream.</p>
    <p>5. Live a creative life. You can put your creativity into everything - from business, to art and parenting.</p>
    <p>If you want to learn more about this story, Rodriguez wrote a book about it called "Rebel Without A Crew."</p>

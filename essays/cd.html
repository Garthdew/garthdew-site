    <h1>On The Creative's Delimma</h1>
    <p>There is a conflict inside commercial creatives.</p>
    <p>They were once artists.</p>
    <p>They created just to create.</p>
    <p>Then, one day, they chose to make a living from their craft.</p>
    <p>They started trading creative labour for money.</p>
    <p>When this happens, the work cannot stay pure.</p>
    <p>This is not wrong.</p>
    <p>We all need money, so why not earn it doing what you enjoy?</p>
    <p>But over time, commercial work is all you do.</p>
    <p>You stop creating just to create.</p>
    <p>Your craft becomes a job, like washing the dishes or cutting the grass.</p>
    <p>You start to loathe the thing you once loved.</p>
    <p>This causes a conflict inside you.</p>
    <p>As time goes on, you get so into making money from your craft that the mind blocks any attempt at art.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the point?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>"Why do this when I could be working?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;My art is bad. Let&rsquo;s stick to client work.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>The longer you walk this path, the more you hurt your soul.</p>
    <p>And the less creative you become.</p>
    <p>This is why I make time for my own art.</p>
    <p>Some music here, a street photo there.</p>
    <p>It keeps the fire alive.</p>
    <p>It is the best thing you can do for yourself and your clients.</p>
    <p>So you can bring your magic to everything you do.</p>
    <p>Your art is not trivial. Do not treat it that way.</p>

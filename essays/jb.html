    <h1>On Just Being</h1>
    <p>I built a den with my kids yesterday.</p>
    <p>When it was done, I sat inside with my eldest.</p>
    <p>She said, "What would we do all day if we lived here?"</p>
    <p>It got me thinking.</p>
    <p>For most of humankind's existence, the only focus was not dying.</p>
    <p>But now, we've built a world that makes that much easier.</p>
    <p>So, we distract ourselves with stories about politics, work, status, money, purpose and so on.</p>
    <p>All of it just concepts.</p>
    <p>And so when my daughter asked me that question...</p>
    <p>I reflected on the superfluousness of the things we take so seriously.</p>
    <p>Now, isn't this a great realisation to live from?</p>
    <p>Like, if you could strip away all the stories and conditioning...</p>
    <p>And create life from a blank canvas...</p>
    <p>As your true self...</p>
    <p>What type of life would you live?</p>
    <p>What would be possible for you?</p>
    <p>My response to my daughter:</p>
    <p>"We'd just BE."</p>

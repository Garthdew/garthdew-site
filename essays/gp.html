    <h1>On Permission</h1>
    <p>From the day we're born, we live up to the expectations of others.</p>
    <p>First, our parents.</p>
    <p>Then our friends and teachers.</p>
    <p>Then our spouse and employers.</p>
    <p>We worry so much about what others think.</p>
    <p>It's easy to go through a lifetime without ever living your truth.</p>
    <p>One of the most empowering things you can do is to give yourself permission.</p>
    <p>To choose your own path.</p>
    <p>To do what excites you.</p>
    <p>To start.</p>
    <p>To quit.</p>
    <p>Giving yourself permission is the greatest gift you can give to yourself and the world.</p>
    <p>When you follow the heart, you are alive.</p>

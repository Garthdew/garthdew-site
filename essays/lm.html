    <h1>On Treating Life Like Music</h1>
    <p>When I was 8, my dad played me the Otis Blue album.</p>
    <p>I loved it.</p>
    <p>When I was 11, I heard Americana by The Offspring.</p>
    <p>Otis was no longer cool.</p>
    <p>In high school, my hormones changed.</p>
    <p>I got moodier.</p>
    <p>Too moody even for The Offspring.</p>
    <p>So I listened to Rage Against the Machine and Slipknot.</p>
    <p>At 15, I started going to parties.</p>
    <p>Dance music finally made sense.</p>
    <p>Now, at 37, I explore new sounds all the time.</p>
    <p>Nothing is off limits.</p>
    <p>My point?</p>
    <p>With music, we&rsquo;re fine dropping an artist or genre when it no longer fits.</p>
    <p>We don&rsquo;t keep playing the same songs just because we always have.</p>
    <p>That would seem limiting. And stupid.</p>
    <p>But we do it in life...</p>
    <p>Especially when we think the stakes are higher.</p>
    <p>We stick with projects we no longer care about.</p>
    <p>We stay in relationships that hold us back.</p>
    <p>We believe things that no longer help us grow.</p>
    <p>All because we've done it for so long.</p>
    <p>But what if we treated life like music?</p>
    <p>What if we engaged fully in something...</p>
    <p>Then let go when it ran its course?</p>
    <p>To make room for the next wonderful thing.</p>
    <p>What impact would that have?</p>
    <p>Treat life like music.</p>

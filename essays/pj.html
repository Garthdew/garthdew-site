    <h1>On Living With Peace And Joy</h1>
    <p>It was the middle of the pandemic.</p>
    <p>Midnight.</p>
    <p>I was on the couch with a large bourbon.</p>
    <p>My mind was in pieces.</p>
    <p>I was looking after my toddler full-time.</p>
    <p>Unsure if my business would survive.</p>
    <p>Worried about family.</p>
    <p>Stressed.</p>
    <p>That night, I stumbled on a lecture by Anthony De Mello.</p>
    <p>He was answering the question:</p>
    <p>How do you live with peace and joy?</p>
    <p>It hit me hard.</p>
    <p>I took notes and found them again recently.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>To live with peace and joy:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Be me.</li>
    <li>Be now.</li>
    <li>Be here.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Be me</strong></p>
    <p>Drop prejudices, preconceptions, and programming.</p>
    <p>Observe myself.</p>
    <p>Ask, "Who is that person?"</p>
    <p>Ask, "What voices are they listening to?"</p>
    <p>Question what you spend your time on.</p>
    <p>Are you a robot?</p>
    <p>Or are you living?</p>
    <p><strong>Be now</strong></p>
    <p>How much time do you spend in the past or the future?</p>
    <p>The past isn&rsquo;t real.</p>
    <p>The future isn&rsquo;t real.<br /><br />It&rsquo;s all in your head.</p>
    <p>Come into the now.</p>
    <p>Don't clean the cup to drink the coffee.</p>
    <p>Clean the cup.</p>
    <p>Focus on breathing in and breathing out.</p>
    <p>Be present.</p>
    <p>Be engaged.</p>
    <p>Do things to experience life.</p>
    <p>Walking.</p>
    <p>Playing.</p>
    <p>Reading.</p>
    <p>Cooking.</p>
    <p>Creating.</p>
    <p>Conversing.</p>
    <p>Observe.<br /><br />Take it all in.</p>
    <p><strong>Be here</strong></p>
    <p>Come out of the head and into the senses.</p>
    <p>Come out of distraction and into experience.</p>
    <p>Ideas and abstractions are not life.</p>
    <p>Experience is life.</p>
    <p>Tasting.</p>
    <p>Seeing.</p>
    <p>Hearing.</p>
    <p>Look at the wonder of a child seeing something new.</p>
    <p>"The day we teach the child the name of the bird is the day the child stops seeing the bird." (Krishnamurti.)</p>
    <p>The bird becomes an idea in their mind.<br /><br />They miss its uniqueness.<br /><br />The name is the obstacle to seeing.<br /><br />The answer:<br /><br />See the bird right now.</p>
    <p>Listen to the sound of the bird right now.</p>
    <p><strong>Enlightenment</strong></p>
    <p>When I see, I see.<br /><br />When I hear, I hear.<br /><br />When I touch, I touch.</p>
    <p><strong>So...</strong></p>
    <p>Observe yourself.<br /><br />Stop the puppet act.<br /><br />Experience reality.<br /><br />Come to your senses.</p>

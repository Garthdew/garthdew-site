    <h1>On On Freelancing Well</h1>
    <p>Your priority is not to get more clients, it&rsquo;s to get better clients</p>
    <p>Your biggest assets are your portfolio, reputation and network. Build them.</p>
    <p>Get comfortable riding the wave through&nbsp;busy and quiet times.</p>
    <p>One freelancer asks, &ldquo;What do you want me to do?&rdquo; Another asks, &ldquo;What are you trying to achieve?&rdquo; One is stuck in a race to the bottom. Another is charging on value.</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t try to do work like everyone else. Develop a style, one that hopefully divides opinion.</p>
    <p>Social media is not essential. The best gigs come from people you know personally.</p>
    <p>Word of mouth is the game. Being great to work with fuels it.</p>
    <p>Do creative projects for yourself. They keep your soul alive, and their authenticity ironically makes them your best marketing tools.</p>
    <p>You can get what you want if you help others get what they want.</p>
    <p>Never stop broadening your skillset and experimenting. Be ready to change direction at any moment.</p>
    <p>Learn how to sell, price projects and write proposals. This can&rsquo;t be learned in a classroom. Go out and do it. Each mistake is a lesson.</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t outsource the creative work.</p>
    <p>Build a process for every part of your business.</p>
    <p>Keep track of every single contact, conversation and enquiry. Keep in touch regularly.</p>
    <p>Figure out how to become more valuable to your best clients.</p>

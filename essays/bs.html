    <h1>On The Barbell Strategy</h1>
    <p>Have you heard of Nassim Taleb's barbell strategy?</p>
    <p>It's one of my favourite takeaways from his book Antifragile.</p>
    <p>It's about being wary of the &ldquo;middle path&rdquo; in business and life.</p>
    <p>What often looks like balance is actually risk, disguised as safety.</p>
    <p>Take investing.</p>
    <p>We are told to stick our funds in a tracker.</p>
    <p>But what happens when a Black Swan (big/unpredictable) event hits?</p>
    <p>A tweet, a tariff, a pandemic, and 20% of your pension can disappear.</p>
    <p>It's the same in business.</p>
    <p>I see a lot of creatives trying to build studios/agencies.</p>
    <p>Hiring staff. Growing overheads.</p>
    <p>It looks like a smart next step.</p>
    <p>But most just end up with more stress, less profit, and no freedom.</p>
    <p>This is where the barbell comes in.</p>
    <p>On one side (majority): caution and safety.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>One person </li>
    <li>Sell a service </li>
    <li>Ability to pivot</li>
    <li>Steady cash flow</li>
    <li>A dozen great clients</li>
    <li>High interest cash accounts</li>
    <li>Simple operation, low overheads</li>
    </ul>
    <p>On the other (minority): risky bets with big potential upside.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Creating experimental art</li>
    <li>Side projects that can scale</li>
    <li>Cryptocurrency and speculative stocks</li>
    <li>Wild experiments that could change everything</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>And nothing in the middle.</strong></p>
    <p>That way, you remove the risk of complete ruin, but open yourself up to big potential returns.</p>
    <p>Another good example is running.</p>
    <p>A proven strategy is to run at a very low intensity for 80% of your training.</p>
    <p>Then train very hard for 20%.</p>
    <p>Meaning you build your aerobic base slowly and safely, while pushing your limits just enough to improve speed and power.</p>
    <p>No grinding at a &ldquo;fast but not fast enough&rdquo; pace every day.</p>
    <p>No burnout. No injuries. No false sense of progress.</p>
    <p>Avoid the middle.</p>
    <p>That&rsquo;s how the real gains are made.</p>
    <p>This isn't true, but it could be useful.</p>

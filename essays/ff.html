    <h1>On Flow Over Fear</h1>
    <p>The most fun I had playing rugby was when I went to high school at 11.</p>
    <p>It was pure flow and joy with my friends.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>At 13, representative rugby and competitions were introduced.</p>
    <p>Over the next 7 years, I won the cups and got the caps.</p>
    <p>From Lancashire U13s to England U19s.</p>
    <p>But the more I achieved externally, the more the fun faded internally.</p>
    <p>And I started to play from a place of fear rather than flow.</p>
    <p>I wouldn't change any of those experiences.</p>
    <p>I was so fortunate to have them.</p>
    <p>But what I've learned is that operating from a place of fear is so limiting to our potential.</p>
    <p>If we could let go of our fears in our personal and professional lives...</p>
    <p>How much more authentic, expansive, joyful and rich could they be?</p>

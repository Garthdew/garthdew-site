    <h1>On Cold Emailing</h1>
    <p>If you want to make interesting things happen...</p>
    <p>Get in the habit of emailing people you admire or find interesting.</p>
    <p>Whether it's an athlete, author, artist, or founder.</p>
    <p>Doing this has led to some of my best projects and relationships.</p>
    <p>The key is to be genuine and not make huge asks, like "become my mentor" or "buy my services."</p>
    <p>Just share what you appreciate about them or their work.</p>
    <p>An email like that can make someone's day, no matter how 'big time' they are.</p>
    <p>It may lead somewhere, it may not, it's all good.</p>
    <p>For me, it's far more effective, and fun, than posting into the social media abyss.</p>
    <p>Or cold email blasting businesses you have no interest in whatsoever.</p>
    <p>Marketing and sales doesn't have to be sleazy.</p>
    <p>It's just about building genuine relationships.</p>
    <p>Sometimes the best approach is just being a human.</p>

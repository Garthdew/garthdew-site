    <h1>On Our Internal Stories</h1>
    <p>The stories we tell ourselves shape our reality.</p>
    <p>I caught myself in a familiar loop the other day.</p>
    <p>That voice saying "You're so unfocussed. Pick a lane."</p>
    <p>But then I remembered&mdash;these stories aren't facts. They're just default programming running in the background.</p>
    <p>In conversation, I often hear so many limiting narratives:</p>
    <p>"I'm too old"</p>
    <p>"I'll be happy when..."</p>
    <p>"I'm not experienced enough"</p>
    <p>"I don't have the confidence to do that"</p>
    <p>All stories. Not facts.</p>
    <p>What if we rewrote these scripts? What if we lived from a place of possibility instead?</p>
    <p>"I have such a wealth of experience to draw from"</p>
    <p>"I choose to be happy today no matter what happens"</p>
    <p>"Age is not a factor, I am good enough to deliver for this client"</p>
    <p>"I am complete and whole, and I fully believe in myself and my abilities"</p>
    <p>I tried this approach with my own story.</p>
    <p>Rather than "scattered," I started seeing myself as "curious."</p>
    <p>Instead of "unfocused," I became a "doer of projects."</p>
    <p>The shift was subtle at first.</p>
    <p>But over time, the new story changed how I showed up.</p>
    <p>I stopped apologising for exploring multiple interests.</p>
    <p>And started embracing the connections between them.</p>
    <p>That's the thing about stories&mdash;they create the lens through which we see everything.</p>
    <p>Change your stories, change your life.</p>
    <p>What story are you telling yourself today?</p>

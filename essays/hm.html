    <h1>On The Happiest Man</h1>
    <p>I was on holiday in Corfu.</p>
    <p>One day, I went on a hike with a local guide.</p>
    <p>We explored caves, private beaches, olive groves and remote villages.</p>
    <p>We talked about all sorts - from culture, to food, diet, exercise, parenting and philosophy.</p>
    <p>The conversation was easy and enjoyable.</p>
    <p>Here's how his life looks:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Father of two grown boys.</li>
    <li>Runs a family business doing hiking, bike tours and home cooking classes with small groups of tourists.</li>
    <li>Works half days throughout summer.</li>
    <li>In winter, rides his motorbike through Europe and goes skiing.</li>
    <li>Grows all his own vegetables, and has 17 olive trees which produce 91kg of extra-virgin olive oil per year.</li>
    <li>Built his family home in a remote village for the cost of an average UK terrace house.</li>
    <li>Enjoys a glass of local wine each evening with a home-cooked family meal.</li>
    <li>Never had more than a mild cold and has an annual MOT which he always passes with flying colours.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>He seemed like the happiest man I had ever met..</p>

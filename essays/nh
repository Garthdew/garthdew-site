    <h1>Essay Title</h1>
    <p>I have joined many coaching programs and courses.</p>
    <p>The promises of more money with less work pulled me in. Even as a natural skeptic, direct marketing still got me.</p>
    <p>Most of these programs were garbage. Some had good ideas. Like the 6-month program about how to productise your creative services.</p>
    <p>But here&rsquo;s the big problem with them all: what worked for someone else probably won&rsquo;t work for you.</p>
    <p>You are a one-of-a-kind body and mind. Your biology and life events shaped you in unmatched ways.</p>
    <p>One person&rsquo;s path to wealth, fitness, or happiness almost never fits another.</p>
    <p>Some truths ring across time. They can guide you. But you must carve your own path.</p>
    <p>That being said, I have spent 6 months in coaching with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAiBAH8B_23QVYh4syi2BkjB94oSx35xTPc"><strong>Sam</strong></a>. This coaching is different.</p>
    <p>Sam does not give advice. He listens. He asks sharp questions. He helps me find my own answers by trusting my gut.</p>
    <p>Now I see the truth: Prescriptive coaching fails.</p>
    <p>The only coaching that works makes space for you to find your own answers.</p>
    <p>Follow your intuition. Bet on yourself.</p>

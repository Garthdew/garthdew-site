    <h1>On The Gift Of Parenting</h1>
    <p>As parents, we are told to do our duty.</p>
    <p>To be there for our children.</p>
    <p>To provide for our children.</p>
    <p>To love, cherish and entertain our children.</p>
    <p>It's our duty.</p>
    <p>But who wants to do duties?</p>
    <p>No one.</p>
    <p>When we're doing our duties, we'd rather be doing something else.</p>
    <p>Duties are hard.</p>
    <p>They require effort.</p>
    <p>And when there is effort, or forced behavior, there is internal conflict.</p>
    <p>Because there is duality.</p>
    <p>And when there is conflict, there can't be awareness, peace or happiness.</p>
    <p>So... when you treat parenting as a duty, it becomes a chore.</p>
    <p>You're constantly looking ahead to when you will be alone.</p>
    <p>And you miss the magic.</p>
    <p>You see, kids are not a duty.</p>
    <p>They are an opportunity.</p>
    <p>An opportunity to unlearn your conditioning.</p>
    <p>An opportunity to rediscover your imagination.</p>
    <p>An opportunity to live completely in the moment.</p>
    <p>To have no concept of the past or future.</p>
    <p>To be totally engaged.</p>
    <p>To have no concept of what should be.</p>
    <p>Only to know what is.</p>
    <p>Children can teach us more than we can teach them.</p>
    <p>Not because they have something we don't.</p>
    <p>But because they don't have something we have.</p>
    <p>The mind and all its programming, anxiety, hate, fear, greed and stress.</p>
    <p>What if you treated parenting as an opportunity to live completely in the moment?</p>
    <p>All you have to do is go onto their level, and enter their world.</p>
    <p>You will be fully engaged.</p>
    <p>When you are fully engaged, you lose the mind.</p>
    <p>Then you can connect with your child in peace, and develop a true relationship with no ideas of what should be.</p>
    <p>Only experiencing what is, and the joy of this very moment.</p>

    <h1>On Embarrassing Yourself</h1>
    <p>Sometimes I feel bored with my core business.</p>
    <p>10 years is a long time to do the same thing week in, week out.</p>
    <p>I often feel bad for this.</p>
    <p>&rdquo;You&rsquo;ve worked hard to get here. Get your head down and push on!&rdquo;</p>
    <p>But the other day, I read a great reframe on this point.</p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re feeling bored with business or life, you&rsquo;re not risking embarrassment enough.</p>
    <p>We stay stuck where we are, doing the same old things, because we&rsquo;re scared of embarrassing ourselves doing something new.</p>
    <p>For example, I&rsquo;ve started writing about topics that are different to what I&rsquo;m known for.</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m risking embarrassment if my posts flop.</p>
    <p>Or if people think, &lsquo;What is Garth on about?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>And writing about topics like health or spirituality, that could seem 'cringe.'</p>
    <p>But writing gives me a lot of energy.</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m excited to work on it.</p>
    <p>And I know it will lead somewhere interesting.</p>
    <p>Like building new relationships or attracting opportunities.</p>
    <p>So if you&rsquo;re feeling bored, find some ways of potentially embarrassing yourself.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Ask someone on a date who is &lsquo;out of your league&rsquo;.</li>
    <li>Start a side project around something you&rsquo;re excited about.</li>
    <li>Start writing online to attact like minds, even if your friends take the piss.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It will add some zest to your life and you never know where it could lead.</p>

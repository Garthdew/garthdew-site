    <h1>On Hunting Antelope</h1>
    <p>A great question for creative people:</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Are you chasing field mice or&nbsp;hunting antelope?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Field mice are the little, insignificant projects.</p>
    <p>They're easier to catch, but you can't live on field mice.</p>
    <p>The antelope is the big, meaningful project.</p>
    <p>It's going to be much harder to catch, but the rewards will be huge. You can thrive on antelope.</p>
    <p>What is the possibility that would get you stoked about the future?</p>
    <p>The thing so big and mind-blowing that you barely dare to think it?</p>
    <p>Spend some time pondering that.</p>

    <p><em>As seen on The Kendal Mountain Player</em></p>
    <p>Alex Staniforth is no stranger to overcoming challenges, having survived the two biggest disasters in Mount Everest history as a teenager and battled mental ill health, epilepsy, a stammer and bullying since school. An adventurer, ultra-runner, author and charity founder, he became the fastest person ever to climb all 100 UK county tops by human power and in 2020 ran the National Three Peaks Challenge – covering 452 miles in just 9 days 12 hours. However, in 2022 Alex faced a different kind of endurance challenge – Long Covid. Unable to pursue his goals as an athlete, he discovered the healing power of open water swimming for mental health. This film explores Alex's journey of identity, discovery and recovery, and his ambitious attempt at a comeback challenge – the Frog Graham Round.</p>

  <p style="text-align: center;">Created entirely with the Roland SH-101 synthesiser and two FX pedals, this album emerged from a deliberate embrace of creative constraints. Completed in two weeks during a period of personal experimentation, the work captures unfiltered moments of creative flow. The music weaves together peaceful soundscapes, playful melodies, textured drones, and hazy arpeggios. Each track represents a different approach to immediate creation: live single-take performances, generative loop layering, and explorations of the SH-101's onboard arpeggiator. The work challenges the perfectionism and rigidity of contemporary music production, finding freedom through restriction. The synthesiser becomes both instrument and collaborator, its analogue unpredictability shaping compositions that prioritise spontaneity over polish.</p>

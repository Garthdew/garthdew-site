    <h3>Photographs made in Preston city centre, 2015&ndash;2025</h3>
    <p>I grew up in Preston, England, and still live here. I didn&rsquo;t have an agenda when I started taking these photographs &mdash; I was simply curious about the people who passed through the city centre each day.&nbsp;As the city began to transform under the Preston Model &mdash; a celebrated approach to Community Wealth Building &mdash; I found myself documenting its surface changes. The indoor market, second-hand stalls, and indie shops quietly disappeared beneath the promise of progress.&nbsp;People still gathered, but now in unfamiliar spaces. I was capturing transition, but also continuity. The people stayed the same, even as the surroundings shifted.&nbsp;This isn&rsquo;t a political statement. It&rsquo;s just what I saw.</p>

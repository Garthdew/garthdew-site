  <h1 style="text-align: center;">The Documentaries</h1>
  
  <p style="text-align: center;">In 2018, I started producing original short documentaries. The stories I was drawn to were of men pursuing their potential in challenging circumstances. Created between 2019-2024, these films have taken on a life of their own - featured on BBC and The Kendal Mountain Player, touring UK film nights, and inspiring thousands of viewers.</p>

  <p style="text-align: center;">Alex Staniforth is no stranger to overcoming challenges, having survived the two biggest disasters in Mount Everest history as a teenager and battled mental ill health, epilepsy, a stammer and bullying since school. An adventurer, ultra-runner, author and charity founder, he became the fastest person ever to climb all 100 UK county tops by human power and in 2020 ran the National Three Peaks Challenge – covering 452 miles in just 9 days 12 hours. However, in 2022 Alex faced a different kind of endurance challenge – Long Covid. Unable to pursue his goals as an athlete, he discovered the healing power of open water swimming for mental health. This film explores Alex's journey of identity, discovery and recovery, and his ambitious attempt at a comeback challenge – the Frog Graham Round.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Work Hard Keep Pushing</h2>
  <p style="text-align: center;">This film tells the story of rugby player Oga Mabaya, who was born in Zimbabwe in 1990 but left in 2005 to escape the economic crisis and seek better opportunities in England with his family. Moving to a rural town in the North of England proved difficult, but Oga used his love for rugby to integrate into a new country, make new friends and build a better life. He dreamt of playing 1st XV rugby for his adopted club, Preston Grasshoppers, but with a self-professed lack of talent and physical ability that seemed unlikely. However, Oga committed to doing everything he could to make that dream a reality, and his story is testament to the old adage that there is no substitute for hard work. As Oga says, 'I am no superstar, but I'm the best version of me that I can be.' In the end, that's all we can strive for, and hopefully this film will give everyone the belief and motivation to achieve their goals, no matter how big, small, or insignificant they may seem to others.</p>

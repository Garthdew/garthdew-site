  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Head Above Water</h2>
  <p style="text-align: center;"><em>As seen on The Kendal Mountain Player</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">Alex Staniforth is no stranger to overcoming challenges, both in the outdoors and everyday life, having survived the two biggest disasters in Mount Everest history as a teenager and suffered with mental ill health, epilepsy, a stammer and bullying since school.</p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">An adventurer, ultra-runner, author and charity founder, he is now the fastest person ever to climb all 100 UK county tops by human power and in 2020 he ran the National Three Peaks Challenge – covering 452 miles in just 9 days 12 hours.</p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">However, in 2022 Alex faced a different kind of endurance challenge – Long Covid.</p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">Whilst unable to pursue his goals as an athlete, he discovered the healing power of open water swimming for mental health.</p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">This film explores Alex's journey of identity, discovery and recovery, and his ambitious attempt at a comeback challenge – the Frog Graham Round.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Work Hard Keep Pushing</h2>
  <p style="text-align: center;">'Work Hard, Keep Pushing' tells the story of rugby player Oga Mabaya. Oga was born in Zimbabwe in 1990 but left in 2005 to escape the economic crisis and seek better opportunities in England with his family.</p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">Moving to a rural town in the North of England proved to be a difficult transition for Oga, but he used his love for rugby to help himself integrate into a new country, make new friends and lead a better life.</p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">Oga dreamt of playing 1st XV rugby for his adopted club, Preston Grasshoppers, but with a self professed lack of talent and physical ability that seemed unlikely. However, Oga committed to doing everything that he could to make that dream a reality, and his story is testament to the old adage that there is no substitute for hard work.</p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">Oga says, 'I am no superstar, but I'm the best version of me that I can be.'</p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">In the end, that's all we can strive for, and hopefully this film will give everyone the belief and motivation to go out and achieve their goals, no matter how big, small, or insignificant they may seem to others.</p>

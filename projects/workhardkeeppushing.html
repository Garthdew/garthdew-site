    <p>This film tells the story of rugby player Oga Mabaya, who was born in Zimbabwe in 1990 but left in 2005 to escape the economic crisis and seek better opportunities in England with his family. Moving to a rural town in the North of England proved difficult, but Oga used his love for rugby to integrate into a new country, make new friends and build a better life. He dreamt of playing 1st XV rugby for his adopted club, Preston Grasshoppers, but with a self-professed lack of talent and physical ability that seemed unlikely. However, Oga committed to doing everything he could to make that dream a reality, and his story is testament to the old adage that there is no substitute for hard work. As Oga says, 'I am no superstar, but I'm the best version of me that I can be.' In the end, that's all we can strive for, and hopefully this film will give everyone the belief and motivation to achieve their goals, no matter how big, small, or insignificant they may seem to others.</p>

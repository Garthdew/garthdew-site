    <h1>Now</h1>
    <p><em>Updated 20th May, 2025, from Lancashire UK.</em></p>
    <p>Living in Lancashire, raising my small family.</p>
    <p>Work-wise, still running my <a href="gdvideo.co.uk">video studio</a> day-to-day, but I'm also exploring ideas for personal projects and experiments (as always!)</p>
    <p>After a few years of intense running, I am getting back into kettelbells, following the minimalist protocols of Pavel Tsatsouline. They are seriously effective for strength and general physical preparation.</p>
    <p>I am also getting into tea after reading The Importance Of Living and The Book Of Tea. I haven't had coffee for a while as a result, and love the whole philosophy around "Teaism." Could be a new obsession.</p>
    <p>I also finally got round to making this personal website. I've collated all my projects here and hope to see this evolving into a long-term documentation of my life to look back on.</p>

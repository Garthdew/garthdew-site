    <h1>Now</h1>
    <p>Updated 20th May, 2025, from Lancashire UK.</p>
    <h3>Business</h3>
    <p>Still running GD Video, but have become more picky about the projects I take on. Made the decision to double down on a handful of clients and become more useful to them. The resulting regular income is allowing me to explore other creative projects and ideas.</p>
    <h3>Artist Rekindled</h3>
    <p>I am planning an experience to help others reconnect with their inner artist and publish an original body of work. The first edition will be around photography, with the aim of publishing a group zine at the conclusion.</p>
    <h3>Original Art</h3>
    <p>I've been creating original art over the last 12 months, for the first time since I was at university. I am going between music and photography primarily. It's such a joy to create for it's own sake again.</p>
    <p>Coaching</p>
    <p>I have been working with a coach over the last six months which has been transformative. I joined to work on my business, but it's really all been about exploring my internal narratives and how they shape my reality. I now feel like I'm coming home to my self, and living in harmony with my true nature.</p>

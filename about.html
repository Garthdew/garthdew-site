        <p>Now In Flow is my container for exploring a single question: what happens when you stop forcing life and flow with it?</p>
        
        <p>For most of my life, I did what we're told to do if we want to succeed. From being a pro athlete to starting a creative business, I strategised, set goals, grinded, strived. And yet whenever I achieved something, the destination felt empty.</p>
        
        <p>Meanwhile, other things kept wanting to come through. Art. Music. Photography. Projects that felt alive but seemed self-indulgent. I'd dismiss them because they weren't going to pay the bills or earn recognition. What was the point?</p>
        
        <p>That changed during a year of integrative development coaching. I came to understand my true nature and started actually listening to it. From there, art happened. Magic happened. As I went with the flow in integrity with myself, I found better productivity, stability, and results than I ever had striving. I realised everything was already unfolding of its own accord, so why fight against it?</p>
        
        <p>So I replaced the grind with creativity, spontaneity, and play. I started focusing on things that gave me a sense of ease and expansion, even if they only existed for their own sake.</p>
        
        <p>This is the place where all of that lives. Stories and art from myself and others exploring this shift in ways of being. Towards flow. Towards listening to your truth and living in integrity with it.</p>
        
        <p>Things are published when ready. Not on a schedule. A limited-run print magazine collects the best of them.</p>
        
        <h2>Studio</h2>
        
        <p>Through Now In Flow Studio, I work with a small number of aligned brands and people, creating films, photography, and long-form content that matter. This is where my client work lives in integrity with everything else. If you're building something real and want it told honestly, <a href="mailto:hello@nowinflow.com">get in touch</a>.</p>

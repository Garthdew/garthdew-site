    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I've never liked the idea of "staying in my lane." Labels and titles are limiting. I'm more verb than noun. If pressed for a title, I'd choose "doer."<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>Playing pro rugby. Making films. Recording music. Taking photographs. Writing. Running. Building businesses. Creating experiences. Guiding others. Following my curiosity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>For over a decade, I've run a video studio telling stories for global brands. Recently, I've shifted toward creating original art. I split my time between client projects and personal work&mdash;following what makes me feel alive. Sometimes it leads to a film, sometimes a business, sometimes a run through the hills.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>All my projects stem from one question: What happens when I stop performing and start being myself?</p>

Built a house. Discovered running. Had our second child. Grew my business. Explored spirituality and prioritised happiness. A transformative decade.</p>

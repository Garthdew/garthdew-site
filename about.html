    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I am an artist, filmmaker, photographer &amp; musician based in Lancashire, UK.</p>
    <p>My <a href="/projects">original work</a> stems from a deep curiosity about the human experience and the world around me. I pay attention to people, places, emotions and the creative forces that guide me, capturing what emerges in the way that feels most natural. My practice creates a container for presence - a space where I can cultivate awareness, enter flow, and stay open to the work that wants to come through me.</p>
    <p>I also run <a href="https://gdvideo.co.uk">GD Video</a>,&nbsp;a story-first video production company, where&nbsp;I create cinematic films that help brands and personalities build deeper connections with their audiences.</p>

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I've never liked the idea of "staying in my lane."</p>
    <p>Labels and titles are limiting.</p>
    <p>I'm more verb than noun. If pressed for a title, I'd choose doer of projects.</p>
    <p>Some projects span years: becoming a professional rugby player, building a video studio that tells stories for global brands.</p>
    <p>Others are brief but intense: running an ultramarathon, recording an ambient album, capturing street photography, creating an event.</p>
    <p>I spend my days making things &mdash; sometimes for clients, sometimes for myself.</p>
    <p>Films, music, photos, tools, experiences.</p>
    <p>Every project begins with curiosity and brings me closer to who I really am.</p>
    <p><strong>My life unfolds inside the question: What happens when I stop performing and just be myself?</strong></p>
    <h2>Timeline</h2>
    <p><strong>0-11:</strong> Being a kid.</p>
    <p><strong>11-18:</strong> Obsessed with rugby. Set and achieved a goal of playing international schoolboy rugby.</p>
    <p><strong>18-23:</strong> Joined Sale Sharks. Played in the Junior Rugby World Cup. After contract release, pivoted to a music production degree while playing semi-pro. Post-graduation, a devastating knee injury forced retirement.</p>
    <p><strong>23-26:</strong> Hit rock bottom. Started working in a sportswear company warehouse, eventually moving to their office as a video producer. Learned filmmaking on the job and rebuilt my life.</p>
    <p><strong>26-36:</strong> Founded my own video studio. Became head coach at Preston Grasshoppers. Met my wife. Bought a house. Welcomed our first child. Left rugby to focus on business. Built a house. Discovered running. Had our second child. Grew my business. Explored spirituality and prioritised happiness. A transformative decade.</p>
    <p><strong>Now:</strong> Running my video studio and embracing fatherhood. Exploring new projects and ways of being. Feel authentically myself for the first time since childhood.</p>

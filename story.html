        <h2>A Creative Studio of One</h2>
        <p>I’m endlessly curious and love working on projects that make me think, learn, and create.</p>
        <p>I’m not here to scale an agency or churn out generic work — I’m here to explore ideas, tell stories, and craft meaningful things through creativity and technology.</p>
        <p>The studio is small by design — it’s just me — which keeps things fast, personal, and flexible. Whether it’s a brand film, a content system, or an AI experiment, you work directly with the person who’s hands-on from start to finish.</p>

        <h2>How I Got Here</h2>
        <p>Before all this, I was a professional rugby player. When injury ended that chapter, I had to completely start over. I picked up a camera, taught myself how to tell visual stories, and slowly built a creative career.</p>
        <p>This initial phase saw me launch a one-person video production company (GD Video). That venture has been a success over the last decade—working with major brands like Volvo, Jaguar Land Rover, Quorn, Speedo, Arla, Autodesk, Neve, Skiddle, Keen, UCLan, and University of Cumbria.</p>
        <p>However, I outgrew the 'video company' label. While film remains a core skill, my curiosity pushed me beyond that single format. I was consistently exploring my own projects across photography, ambient music, digital tools, and launching entrepreneurial side ventures.</p>
        <p>This led me to realise my true value wasn't just in producing content, but in bringing a diverse, strategic skillset to the table.</p>

        <h2>The Studio</h2>
        <p>This is where all of that converges. I bring a powerful mix of discipline, curiosity, and creativity to every challenge:</p>
        
        <ul class="pillars">
            <li><strong>Discipline</strong> from years in sport — showing up and doing the work.</li>
            <li><strong>Creativity</strong> from working on diverse original and commercial projects.</li>
            <li><strong>Curiosity</strong> from having to learn every step of the way.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The studio is where you tap into this multifaceted approach. You get the creative, the technical, and the entrepreneurial mindset working together to solve your specific challenge. I like trying new things, making useful tools, and experimenting in public—and I bring that spirit of innovation to your project.</p>

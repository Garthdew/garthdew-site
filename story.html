        <h2>A Creative Studio of One</h2>
        <p>I’m endlessly curious and love working on projects that make me think, learn, and create.</p>
        <p>I’m not here to scale an agency or churn out generic work — I’m here to explore ideas, tell stories, and craft meaningful things through creativity and technology.</p>
        <p>The studio is small by design — it’s just me — which keeps things fast, personal, and flexible. Whether it’s a brand film, a digital product, or a new experiment, you work directly with the person who’s hands-on from start to finish.</p>

        <h2>How I Got Here</h2>
        <p>Before this, I was a professional rugby player. When injury ended that chapter, I had to start again from scratch. I picked up a camera, taught myself how to tell visual stories, and slowly built a creative career.</p>
        <p>That reinvention shaped how I work today — a powerful mix of discipline, creativity, and curiosity:</p>
        
        <ul class="pillars">
            <li>Discipline from years in sport — showing up and doing the work.</li>
            <li>Creativity from working on original and commercial projects.</li>
            <li>Curiosity from having to learn every step of the way.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <hr>

        <h2>Life Highlights</h2>
        <p style="margin-top: -0.5rem;">These achievements inform the drive and commitment I bring to every project:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Represented England U19 at the Rugby World Cup.</li>
            <li>Became the youngest head coach of a National League rugby team at 26.</li>
            <li>Completed a 50-mile ultra marathon, raising $\pounds 5,000$ for cancer research.</li>
            <li>Degree in music production, grounding my technical and creative skills.</li>
            <li>Dad of two, my number one role in life!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Work</h2>
        <p>Over the years, I’ve worked with brands like Volvo, Jaguar Land Rover, Quorn, Speedo, Arla, Autodesk, Neve, Skiddle, Keen, UCLan, and University of Cumbria — helping them tell stories and connect with people.</p>
        <p>Alongside client work, I explore my own projects  across film, photography, music, and digital products. I like trying new things, making useful tools, and experimenting in public.</p>
        <p>The studio is where all of this converges. You get the creative, the technical, and the entrepreneurial mindset working together to solve your specific challenge.</p>

        <h2>A Creative Studio of One</h2>
        <p>I'm driven by one thing: endless curiosity. My work is about finding the point where imagination meets utility, and I love working on projects that make me think, learn, or create something worthwhile.</p>
        <p>I'm not here to scale an agency or churn out generic work. I'm here to explore ideas, solve problems, and build something interesting or useful—where creativity, storytelling, and technology meet. The studio is intentionally small—it's just me—which keeps the process fast, personal, and adaptable.</p>
        <p>My projects are defined by their diversity, ranging from designing a custom content system to directing a long-form documentary or providing strategic consulting for a brand. Yet, the common thread is always genuine, hands-on creation. I approach commercial briefs and original art projects with the exact same commitment: to explore, solve problems, and achieve a successful outcome.</p>

        <h2>How I Got Here</h2>
        <p>Before all this, I was a professional rugby player. When injury ended that chapter, I had to completely start over. I picked up a camera, taught myself how to tell visual stories, and slowly built a creative career.</p>
        <p>This initial phase saw me launch a one-person video production company (GD Video). That venture was a success over the course of a decade—working with major brands like Volvo, Jaguar Land Rover, Quorn, Speedo, Arla, Autodesk, Neve, Skiddle, Keen, UCLan, and University of Cumbria.</p>
        <p>However, I outgrew the 'video company' label. While film remains a core skill, my curiosity pushed me beyond that single format. I was consistently exploring my own projects across photography, ambient music, digital tools, coaching and launching entrepreneurial side ventures.</p>
        <p>This led me to realise my true value wasn't just in producing content, but in bringing a diverse, strategic skillset to clients and leveraging my own consistent exploration into interesting creative and technical practice to inform all client work.</p>

        <h2>The Studio</h2>
        <p>This is where my entire journey comes together. The studio isn't some corporate entity; it's the space where I explore, solve problems, and build interesting and useful things for myself and others.</p>
        
        <p>When you work with me, you benefit from a decade of hands-on doing and creative exploration:</p>

        <ul class="pillars">
            <li>The Discipline: I bring the non-negotiable standard of a high-performance background. That means showing up, doing the work properly, and delivering reliably.</li>
            <li>The Builder: My drive to launch my own projects—whether it's an app, a documentary, or a new content tool—means I approach your work with an entrepreneurial mindset focused on utility and success.</li>
            <li>The Curious Mind: Constant exploration in art, music, and tech keeps the practice sharp. You get the benefit of fresh ideas and informed practice that keeps the final result interesting and relevant.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The studio's value is this unique mix. You tap into a creative, technical, and driven mind, ensuring the final outcome is always effective and deeply considered.</p>

        <h2>The Person Behind the Work</h2>
        <p>Here is a little context about the person behind the studio:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I represented England U19 at the Rugby World Cup and later became the youngest head coach of a National League rugby team at 26.</li>
            <li>I ran a 52-mile ultra marathon, raising $\pounds 5,000$ for cancer support.</li>
            <li>My creative career began after completing a degree in music production, which grounded my technical and artistic start.</li>
            <li>Husband and father of two—my number one role in life.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Studio</h1>
        
        <p>Now In Flow Studio is where I bring together a decade of creative direction and production experience for brands and people who care deeply about their work.</p>
        
        <p>Over the years, I've worked with global names — Volvo, Speedo, Quorn, Arla, Skiddle — and delivered work I'm proud of. But increasingly I've become jaded with the briefs and formats I was being asked to produce.</p>
        
        <p>I'm more interested in longer-form content that introduces interesting people, stories, and ideas. That's the work I want to do.</p>
        
        <p>For example, I work extensively with AMS Neve, who create handcrafted music consoles and outboard gear that are used by the most renowned studios in the world. For them, I focus on long-form storytelling that does justice to the craft.</p>
        
        <p>I've helped Skiddle empower musicians by creating a documentary series on upcoming bands. I made a mini-doc for Arla about regenerative and organic farming. I partnered with Ellis Brigham to tell the story of Alex Staniforth, an athlete pursuing his potential against the odds.</p>
        
        <p>These are the types of projects I thrive on. The studio is where I work on them.</p>

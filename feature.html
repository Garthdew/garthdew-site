            <h1>Coming Home</h1>
            <p class="story-intro">Three days in Arles. A camera. No plan. What I found wasn't the ancient city I'd come to photograph—it was something quieter, closer. A return to seeing.</p>
        </header>

        <p>I arrived in Arles during Les Rencontres, the photography festival that transforms the city each summer. The streets were full of people moving between exhibitions, cameras around necks, programs in hand. I'd planned to photograph the festival itself—the crowds, the energy, the spectacle of it all.</p>
        
        <p>But on the first morning, walking alone before the exhibitions opened, I realized I had no interest in any of that. The ancient Roman amphitheater caught the early light. A woman swept her doorstep. A cat watched from a windowsill. These quiet, ordinary moments felt more alive than anything I'd planned to capture.</p>

        <p>So I stopped trying to make something happen and just walked. No shot list, no concept, no pressure to come home with anything remarkable. I let the city show me what it wanted to show me.</p>

        <p>What emerged over those three days wasn't a document of Arles. It was a practice of paying attention. Of being present enough to notice light on stone, a gesture, a color I might have walked past a thousand times before.</p>
        
        <p>I wasn't hunting for images. I was allowing them to arrive.</p>

        <p>There's a difference between making photographs and receiving them. One feels like work—scanning, searching, trying to force something into existence. The other feels like grace. You're simply there, awake, and the world offers itself.</p>

        <figure class="story-image">

        <p>On the last morning, sitting in a café near Place du Forum, I looked through the images on my camera. Not many. Maybe thirty across three days. But each one felt true. Not performed, not constructed. Just seen.</p>
        
        <p>I realized this is what I'd been trying to get back to for years—this ease, this trust. The permission to create for no reason other than it feels right. To follow curiosity instead of strategy. To come home to the simplest, most essential part of the work: showing up and seeing what's there.</p>

        <p>Arles didn't teach me anything new. It reminded me of something I already knew but had forgotten. That the best work happens when you stop forcing it. When you trust the flow instead of fighting it. When you remember that creation isn't about producing—it's about being present enough to receive what's already unfolding.</p>
        
        <p>That's what coming home means.</p>
